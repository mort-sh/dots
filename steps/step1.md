## Prompt 1: Repository Structure and Base README

**Objective:** Create the initial repository structure for the **`dotfiles`** project, including platform-specific folders and a base README file.

**Details:**

- The repository should be named **`dotfiles`** and organized into the following top-level directories:
  - **`macos/`** – for macOS-specific configuration files.
  - **`linux/`** – for Linux (Ubuntu) configuration files.
  - **`windows/`** – for Windows-specific configuration files.
  - **`scripts/`** – for setup scripts and bootstrap logic.
- Include a **`README.md`** at the root with an **overview** of the repository, list of supported platforms, basic setup instructions, and a note that detailed documentation will follow.
- Ensure the README is well-formatted (use Markdown headings, lists, etc.) and provides a high-level description without going into full detail (a more comprehensive README will be generated in a later step).
- Show the repository structure in a readable format (e.g., a tree listing or list of directories/files).

**Output:** The LLM should return a structured directory tree and the content of the base `README.md`. For example, it should present the repository layout (using a tree diagram or list) and then a Markdown section for the README content. The README should have placeholders or brief sections for Overview, Platform Support, Setup, and a note about further documentation coming. *(Format the tree and README in Markdown for clarity.)*
