# TODO: Tool Name

This document will be used by users who want to install the tool on a fresh machine. The tool for this document is based on it's parent directory name. You must provide documentation on the configuration of the tool based on the relative files. Your docs must support both MacOS and Windows Powershell.

## TODO: How to install these relative files

Consider:
- If config files, where should i put them ?
- Is the tool even installed?

## TODO: Scripts

Consider
- If scripts, like files ending in `.ps1` or `.sh`, read the files and understand the context on where they should be put. Often the answer is to reference them in the $PROFILE or ~/.zshrc. You decide!

## TODO: MISC

Document anything else relevant to the tool
